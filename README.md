Java solution to the Gilded Rose Kata, base taken from:
https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

Core problem:
- Existing functionality must be maintained as this is a long running production system.
- The Item class "Item.java" cannot be modified.
- A new kind of item is being added to the store, "Conjured" items. These lose quality at twice the rate of normal items.

Repository note: Built in Eclipse using Java 8
